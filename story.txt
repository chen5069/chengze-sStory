Chen likes to play basketball once a week, but he has to do a lot of assignments this week and next week. Therefore, he don't have time to play it. However, he is finishing his programming assignment very quickly, so he might have time to go play. So far, it's been a good day. Chen is looking forward to the night ahead.
